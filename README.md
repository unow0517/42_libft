# Libft
Library of Functions in C. It will be used in most of projects in 42 Curriculum.

# Must Know
* solid knowledge in pointer in c is required.
* memory allocation in c.
* struct, linked list in c.

# Key Point
* take edge cases into consideration when implementing a function, you can check the edge cases  with [Francinette](https://github.com/xicodomingues/francinette) for each function.
* Unlike other easy-to-use programming language like Python, Users should build the functions they need or use library.
* Is C low-level programming language?

*A low-level programming language is a programming language that provides little or no **abstraction** from a computer's instruction set architecture—commands or functions in the language map that are structurally similar to processor's instructions. Generally, this refers to either machine code or assembly language. [^1]*
<br/>

*The terms high-level and low-level are inherently relative. Some decades ago,[timeframe?] the C language, and similar languages, were most often considered "high-level", as it supported concepts such as expression evaluation, parameterised recursive functions, and data types and structures, while assembly language was considered "low-level". **Today, many programmers might refer to C as low-level, as it lacks a large runtime-system (no garbage collection, etc.), basically supports only scalar operations, and provides direct memory addressing;** it therefore, readily blends with assembly language and the machine level of CPUs and microcontrollers. Also, in the introduction chapter of The C Programming Language (second edition) by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie, C is described as "not a very high level" language. [^2]*

**Abstraction**: *Abstraction in OOP(Object-Oriented-Programming)
Objects in an OOP language provide an abstraction that hides the internal implementation details. Similar to the coffee machine in your kitchen, you just need to know which methods of the object are available to call and which input parameters are needed to trigger a specific operation. But you don’t need to understand how this method is implemented and which kinds of actions it has to perform to create the expected result.*[^3] **To decrease the complexity so that user only see the necessary informations.**

# How To Use
1. `git clone https://github.com/unow0517/42_libft.git`
2. `cd 42_Libft`
3. `make`

if you want to use functions in Libft, copy '42_Libft' Folder in the project and compile together.
